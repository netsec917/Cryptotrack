The dashboard gives you the ability to select the base currency used for conversion, as well as order the results obtained by various fields such as high, low, volume etc. You can also choose the number of results returned on a scale of 100-1000 in steps of a 100, for example if you only care about the data for the top 500 coins this will make the application slightly snappier upon data update.
